omd - A Markdown frontend in pure OCaml.
========================================

This Markdown library is implemented using only pure OCaml (including I/O
operations provided by the standard OCaml compiler distribution).  OMD is
meant to be as faithful as possible to the original Markdown.  Additionally,
OMD implements a few Github markdown features, an extension mechanism, and
some other features. Note that the opam package installs both the OMD library
and the command line tool `omd`.

See the file [INSTALL.txt](INSTALL.txt) for building and installation
instructions.
