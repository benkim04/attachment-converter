** Configuration
*** Job of the config file
+ to be the interface between Attachment Converter and the external
  utilities
+ it lists all the conversions AC is going to perform
+ for each conversion, it provides:
  + a source file type 
  + a target file type 
  + a target file extension (optional)
    + this is because there are multiple extension possibilities for
      the same format:
      + e.g. =.jpeg= vs. =.jpg=
      + =.tif= vs. =.tiff=
  + the shell command for the external utility to be invoked
  + a unique numeric id corresponding to each use of a conversion tool
    for such and such particular file format conversion
    + (this information goes in the header of the converted
      attachment, for reference purposes when someone is looking at
      the header later)
+ the =Formats.transform_data= datatype includes information about
  what exact kind of conversion to perform, but also metadata to be
  included in the header of the converted attachment, for reference
  purposes later
*** Default config file
+ the default config file represents the conversions that AC will
  perform out of the box, if the user doesn't customize the config
  file
+ and indeed, we do not expect most of our users to customize the
  config file, because doing so requires some sysadmin/UNIX-level
  expertise
+ we will likely hardcode the default config file in OCaml at some
  point
+ but to make it easier to change, for now we have a shell script
  generate an actual config file that we use as a default
  + this is located at:
    =attachment-converter/make-config.sh=
*** How we regiment the behavior of external utilities
+ At a high level:
  + we wrap each utility in a shell script that accepts standard in
    and ouputs to standard out
  + regardless of what the actual assumptions are of any given utility
    re: the form of the input and the form of the output
+ At a lower level:
  + each utility is assigned a shell script within the app that
    regiments it in the way AC expects
  + the shell scripts are located at:
    =attachment-converter/conversion-scripts=
  + many of them create temp files that we redirect from to get the
    data to be standard in / out, using the following traditional
    shell script pattern:
    #+begin_src bash
      trap 'rm -rf "$TMP_DIR"' EXIT

      TMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)

      ...$TMP_DIR...
    #+end_src
  + the expectation is that if the user wants to use their own
    external utility to convert attachments, a sysadmin on their staff
    will write a short script like this, using the scripts we provide
    as a model
  + each of our scripts accepts some subset of the following command
    line flags:
    + the input extension
    + the output extension
  + this is so that our code can provide that information to our
    wrapper script, in the event that the external utility it invokes
    needs that information
*** Notes on the Code
**** Modules
***** Formats
+ =Formats.t= is the parsed config file
+ This is a dictionary whose keys are the source types, given as MIME
  type strings, and whose values are of type =transform_data=, which
  is a record telling AC what kind of conversion to do with an
  attachment of that source type.
***** ParseConfig
+ the config file parser code
+ =config_key= is an abstraction used internally by the config file
  parsing code
+ parse result is of type =(Formats.t, Error.t) result=
+ =Error.t= is a PV datatype meant to cover config file parse errors
  + =`ReferParse= is for a GNU Refer parse error
  + =`ConfigData= is for if a required field is missing from one of
    the records in the refer database
  + we don't throw an error if there are extra refer fields
