- currently, when attc finds an attachment whose MIME type it doesn't
  recogize, it prints the before and after skeletons (which are
  identical)

- currently, attc checks the config file every time it sees an
  attachment, and then never finds that input mime type, and then
  never converts any attachment
- instead, it should print some kind of error message saying please
  put something in the config file or delete it
