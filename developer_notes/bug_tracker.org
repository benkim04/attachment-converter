* TODO Shell script problem

+ soffice-wrapper.sh should do error handling on extensions (and other
  things) (case statement)

* TODO plaintext shouldn't be base64 encoded

+ for example so that we can use it for searching / search indexing

* TODO throws an exception on keith's CSV email

- will include the actual example, coming soon
- possible cause: no filename?

* TODO email serialization error on Nishchay's HTML email

- will include the actual example, coming soon
- the serialization error only happens using Mr. Mime
- also, let's double check that we are even converting attachments in
  MIME multipart/related emails in general

* TODO app should complain if the config file is empty

- currently, attc checks the config file every time it sees an
  attachment, and then never finds that input mime type, and then
  never converts any attachment
- instead, it should print some kind of error message saying please
  put something in the config file or delete it

* TODO attc shouldn't print before/after skeleton when it doesn't convert

- currently, when attc finds an attachment whose MIME type it doesn't
  recogize, it prints the before and after skeletons (which are
  identical)
- instead, it shouldn't print anything

* TODO line breaks should be consistent

+ we found during iPres that =attc= is sometimes mixing CRLF-s and
  straight LFs
+ we'll need to look at both the OCamlnet and Mr. Mime backends to see
  what's going on with that
+ we should aim to make the line breaks =attc= outputs consistent

* TODO issue parsing multipart/signed emails
+ happens with both OCamlnet and Mr. Mime, OCamlnet gives an "error parsing email" error, Mr. Mime gives a conversion failure when parsing

* TODO -s as shortened flag for --single-email isn't working and isn't in the man page 

* TODO --single-email is not working when attc is run with Mr. Mime
+ works fine with a single email if the --single-email is omitted but gives a parsing error if it is included

* TODO attc won't convert jpeg files if the content-type is not image/jpeg 
+ jpeg attachments with content-types of "image/jpg" or "image/pjpeg" are recognized as attachments and printed in the skeleton, but not converted
+ might be because image/jpeg is the only one that is a registered MIME type

* TODO attc won't convert certain xlsx files
+ wouldn't convert an attachment with content-type application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet, which is a registered MIME type 

* TODO closing " is missing when converted attachment name is printed
+ the unconverted attachment names have closing " but the converted ones do not
