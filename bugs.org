* TODO throws an exception on keith's CSV email
- will include the actual example, coming soon
* TODO email serialization error on Nishchay's HTML email
- will include the actual example, coming soon
* TODO funny empty config file behavior
- if the config file is blank, Attachment Converter prints that it
  converted each attachment to itself
- and seems to actually do that as well, since a diff reveals the
  output MBOX to be identical to the input MBOX except in whitespace,
  etc.
