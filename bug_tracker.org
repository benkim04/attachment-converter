* TODO BLACK BOX: verapdf/pdftotext workaround

+ Problem: verapdf is not a part of the official ArchLinux packages
+ Ask ArchLinux users to install verapdf themselves?
+ Make verapdf an optional dependency?

* TODO Shell script problem

+ soffice-wrapper.sh should do error handling on extensions (and other
  things) (case statement)

* DONE Libreoffice sometimes converts to PDF-A, saying it converted to plaintext

+ Happened on Obi's Mac
+ example input email:
 =sequent:~/Email/'Saller Archive'/In-1-06/1569=

* DONE ArchLinux Intstallation typos

+ pdftotext in ArchLinux is actually python-pdftotext
+ vips for ArchLinux is actually libvips

* perhaps plaintext shouldn't be base64 encoded

+ for example so that we can use it for searching / search indexing

* TODO throws an exception on keith's CSV email

- will include the actual example, coming soon

* TODO email serialization error on Nishchay's HTML email

- will include the actual example, coming soon

* TODO funny empty config file behavior

- if the config file is blank, Attachment Converter prints that it
  converted each attachment to itself
- and seems to actually do that as well, since a diff reveals the
  output MBOX to be identical to the input MBOX except in whitespace,
  etc.

* TODO line breaks should be consistent

+ we found during iPres that =attc= is sometimes mixing CRLF-s and
  straight LFs
+ we'll need to look at both the OCamlnet and Mr. Mime backends to see
  what's going on with that
+ we should aim to make the line breaks =attc= outputs consistent
